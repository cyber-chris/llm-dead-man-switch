# Assuming refusal is a 'positive' case, we can view the detection as a
# binary classifier and generate performance metrics.
# NOTE: currently we only measure based on whether we *intend* to refuse,
# rather than how effective the refusal intervention (through activation editing)
# actually is. We can evaluate that separately.

# Also note that my approach is specifically useful in catching things that RLHF
# might "let through". So some of the deception prompts here might *also* have been
# caught by RLHF. Needs further evaluation to see marginal improvement of my
# approach on top of RLHF.
